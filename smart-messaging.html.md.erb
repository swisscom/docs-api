## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The Smart Messaging API provides different resources around the topic of mobile messaging like sending SMS or validating phone numbers via SMS:

### SMS

Send SMS and check their status.

### Token Validation

Validate a phone number via SMS token. To validate a number, a predefined SMS message with an included textual token will be sent to your customer's mobile phone. The customer then enters this token somewhere in your application (e.g. HTML from, Mail, Callcenter) and you can validate it using this API.

## <a id="creation"> Creation

To create a Smart Messaging service, simply click "Create Service" in the web console or run `cf create-service smartmsg usage my-sms` (replace "my-sms" with the actual name of your service instance).

*Important*: Note that you'll have to activate the service after you have triggered its creation. To do so, click the "Manage" button on the service instance's detail screen in the web console.

### Sending SMS

```txt
POST /messaging/sms
```

<pre class="terminal">
curl -X POST https://api.swisscom.com/messaging/sms -H 'SCS-Version: 2' -H 'client_id: {YourClientID}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'SCS-Request-ID: {YourRequestID}' -d '{"to": "{YourPhoneNumber}", "text": "YourMessageText."}'
</pre>

#### Request

##### Headers

* `client_id` required (See [authentication](#authentication))
* `SCS-Version` required (Must be `2`)
* `Content-Type` required (E.g. `application/json`)
* `Accept` required (Must be `application/json`)
* `SCS-Request-ID` optional (Can be used to trace your request to our API. Only relevant if you need support from our team so they know which request to look into.)

##### Body Example (application/json)

```json

  "from": "Swisscom",
  "to": "+41791234567",
  "text": "Greetings from Swisscom!",
  "callbackUrl": "https://notification.com/service"
}
```

By default, the mobile number you used to create your service instance is used as the sender's number. To display a different sender, you can set the `from` parameter. Notice: you need special permissions to use this parameter. Please contact our support team at developer-support@swisscom.com to get access to this feature.

If you need updates about the SMS state (e.g. SMS was received), you can set the `callBackUrl` parameter. You will receive an HTTP `PUT` request to this URL, for any state change of this SMS.

### Initiate SMS Token Validation process

```txt
POST /messaging/tokenvalidation
```

<pre class="terminal">
curl -X POST https://api.swisscom.com/messaging/tokenvalidation -H 'SCS-Version: 2' -H 'client_id: MyClientID' -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Accept: application/json' -H 'SCS-Request-ID: {YourRequestID}' -d '{"to":"+41791234567", "text":"Take this token: %TOKEN%", "tokenType":"SHORT_NUMERIC", "expireTime":120,"tokenLength":6}'
</pre>

This call will start the SMS Token validation process by sending a validation token to an MSISDN. The validation token is a random string of characters that is sent to the user's mobile phone. After making this call, your application can then verify that the user recieved the validation token by calling the *Validate SMS Token* endpoint.

#### Request

##### Headers

* `SCS-Version` required (Must be `2`)
* `client_id` required (See [authentication](#authentication))
* `Content-Type` required (E.g. `application/json`)
* `Accept` optional (Defaults to `application/json`)
* `SCS-Request-ID` optional (Can be used to trace your request to our API. Only relevant if you need support from our team so they know which request to look into.)

##### Body Example (application/json)

```json
{
  "to": "+41791544781",
  "text": "Verification code: %TOKEN% \r\n Expires in 60 seconds.",
  "tokenType": "SHORT_ALPHANUMERIC",
  "expireTime": 60,
  "tokenLength": 6
}
```

Use `%TOKEN%` as a placeholder for where the actual token should go.

## <a id='authentication'></a> ClientId Authentication

The SMS API requires ClientId authentication. The ClientId is part of the credentials, which are available in the `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable after you [bind the SMS API service to your app](/devguide/services/application-binding.html) or through [service keys](/devguide/services/service-keys.html). For a valid authentication of your requests, you must set the ClientId as HTTP header `client_id` in your requests. See also [examples](#examples) for details.
