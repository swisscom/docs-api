## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The SmartMessaging API provides different resources around the topic of mobile messaging.

### SMS

Resource to send an SMS. It is also possible to receive a status notification.

### Token Validation

Simple resource to validate a phone number by token. To validate a number, a well specified SMS message with an included textual token will be sent to your customer's mobile. Now the customer is able to forward this token to your service (HTML from, Mail, Callcenter). After a quick validation by this resource, you can be sure that phone number belongs to your customer.

### <a id='/messaging/tokenvalidation'></a> /messaging/tokenvalidation

#### POST

This call will start the SMS Token validation process by sending a validation token to an MSISDN. The validation token is a random string of characters that is sent to the user's mobile phone. After making this call, your application can then verify the user recieved the validation token by calling *Validate SMS Token*.

## <a id='authentication'></a> ClientId Authentication

The SMS API requires ClientId authentication. The ClientId is part of the ServiceKey, which is available after you bind the SMS API service to your app (select "Service Keys" tab and press "+ Create Service Key"). For a valid authentication, you must set the ClientId as HTTP header `client_id` in your requests. See also [examples](#examples) for details.

![SmartSmsServiceKey](./img/SmartSmsServiceKey.png)

## <a id='examples'></a> Examples

You can quickly make calls to the Swisscom APIs using [cURL](https://curl.haxx.se) in the command line. If you have not already installed cURL, use the [cURL Download Wizard](https://curl.haxx.se/dlwiz/?type=bin) to get the correct binary.

### Sending SMS

This first call shows how to send a SMS without optional parameter:

<pre class="terminal">
curl -ik -H "SCS-Version: 2" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "client_id:%YOUR_CLIENT_ID%" -X POST "https://api.swisscom.com/messaging/sms" -d "{\"to\": \"+417xxxxxxxx\", \"text\": \"hello world\"}"
</pre>

By default your registered mobile number is used as sender number. To display a different sender number you can set the "from" parameter. Notice: you need special permissions to use this parameter. Please contact our support team, to book this feature.

If you need updates about the SMS state (e.g. SMS was received), you can set the `callBackUrl` parameter. You will receive a HTTP PUT request on this URL, on any SMS state change.

<pre class="terminal">
curl -ik -H "SCS-Version: 2" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "client_id:%YOUR_CLIENT_ID%" -X POST "https://api.swisscom.com/messaging/sms" -d "{\"to\": \"+417xxxxxxxx\", \"from\": \"Swisscom\", \"text\": \"hello world\", \"callbackUrl\": \"http://mydomain.net/notification\"}"
</pre>

### Token Validation

If you want to verify the mobile number of a customer, you can simple send a SMS token with this request:

<pre class="terminal">
curl -ik -H "SCS-Version: 2" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "client_id:%YOUR_CLIENT_ID%" -X POST " https://api.swisscom.com/messaging/sms/tokenvalidation" -d "{\"to\":\"+417xxxxxxxx\",\"text\":\"Take this token: %TOKEN%\", \"tokenType\":\"SHORT_NUMERIC\",\"expireTime\":120,\"tokenLength\":6}"
</pre>

The customer receives the token on his mobile. After he types the token into your web form, you can do a verification with the following request:

<pre class="terminal">
curl -ik -H "SCS-Version: 2" -H "Accept: application/json" -H "client_id:%YOUR_CLIENT_ID%" -X GET " https://api.swisscom.com/messaging/sms/tokenvalidation/00417xxxxxxxx/%RECEIVED_TOKEN_GOES_HERE%"
</pre>
